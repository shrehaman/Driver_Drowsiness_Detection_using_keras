#  Driver Drowsiness Detection
The Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection system is an innovative application developed to detect and prevent driver drowsiness in real-time. By leveraging Haar cascade files for face detection and a comprehensive set of labels, including yawn, no yawn, open eye, and closed eye, the system accurately identifies signs of drowsiness and provides timely alerts to the driver.

Key Features of the Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System:

- Haar Cascade Face Detection: The system utilizes Haar cascade files to detect and track the driver's face in real-time video or by an image. This enables the accurate localization of facial features necessary for drowsiness detection, such as the eyes and mouth.

- Drowsiness Detection: The system incorporates intelligent algorithms to analyze facial expressions and eye movements in order to detect signs of drowsiness. It can recognize patterns associated with yawning, open eyes, closed eyes, and non-drowsy states.

- Customizable Thresholds: The system allows for customizable thresholds and parameters to suit individual driver preferences and requirements. These thresholds can be adjusted based on factors like eye closure duration, yawn frequency, or other relevant indicators of drowsiness.

The Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection system is an essential tool for enhancing driver safety and preventing accidents caused by drowsy driving. By accurately detecting signs of drowsiness in real-time, it provides drivers with timely alerts, promoting vigilance and reducing the risk of accidents.
